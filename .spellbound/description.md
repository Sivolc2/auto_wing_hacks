This project is a Hackathon project for creating a supply chain logistics AI tool, specifically for procurement of inventory. The project takes the modality of a conversational chat (using the StreamLit Python framework). The usage of the application follows the following steps:

1. The user inputs a high-level business plan, like "I want to open a coffee shop in San Francisco"

2. The application will then ask a series of questions to help the user refine their business plan, such as "What kind of coffee shop do you want to open?" or "What kind of coffee do you want to serve?"

3. The application will generate a hierarchical list of items that the user will need to procure in order to open their coffee shop, such as "Coffee Beans" or "Coffee Cups". This will be rendered using a Mermaid tree.
